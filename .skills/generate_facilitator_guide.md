## Description
Help users generate Facilitator Guide (FG) documents for WSQ courses.

## Response
I'll take you to **Generate Courseware** now.

Here's what you'll need:
- **Upload** your approved Course Proposal (CP) document
- **Select** "Facilitator Guide" from the document type options

The system will generate a comprehensive Facilitator Guide with teaching instructions, delivery methods, timing, activities, and discussion points.

**Tip:** The FG should complement the Learner Guide — generate both for a complete set.

## Instructions
When users ask about creating facilitator guides, trainer guides, or FG documents:

1. **Required Input**: Approved Course Proposal (CP) document
2. **Facilitator Guide Contents**:
   - Teaching instructions
   - Delivery methods
   - Timing and pacing
   - Resources needed
   - Activity instructions
   - Discussion points
3. **Process**:
   - Upload approved CP document
   - Select "Facilitator Guide" option
   - Configure instructional methods
   - System generates FG based on CP content
   - Review and download as Word document
4. **Tips**:
   - FG should complement the Learner Guide
   - Include detailed timing for each section
   - Add facilitator notes and tips
   - Specify required materials and resources

## Capabilities

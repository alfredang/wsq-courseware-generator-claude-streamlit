## Response
I'll take you to **Generate Courseware** now.

From here you can generate **4 types of supporting documents**:

| Document | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **AP** | Assessment Plan — assessment methods, rubrics, evidence requirements |
| **FG** | Facilitator Guide — teaching instructions, delivery methods, activities |
| **LG** | Learner Guide — learning content, exercises, self-assessments |
| **LP** | Lesson Plan — session schedules, timing, materials needed |

Here's what you'll need:
- **Upload** your approved Course Proposal (CP) document
- **Select** which document type to generate

**Tip:** Generate all 4 documents from the same CP for a complete, aligned courseware package.

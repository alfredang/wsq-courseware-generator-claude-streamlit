## Response
I'll take you to **Check Documents** now.

Here's what you can do:
- **Upload** your supporting documents (CP, AP, FG, LG, LP, etc.)
- The system will check for completeness, formatting, and alignment between documents

This helps ensure your documents meet SSG submission requirements before you submit.

## Capabilities

## Next Steps
Once your documents pass validation, you're ready for SSG submission! If you need to fix anything:

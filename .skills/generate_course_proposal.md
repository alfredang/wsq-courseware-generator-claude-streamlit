## Description
Help users create Course Proposals (CP) for WSQ courses.

## Response
I'll take you to **Generate Course Proposal** now.

Here's what you'll need:
- **Upload** your TSC (Training & Competency Standards) document (PDF or Word)
- **Fill in** course details: title, duration, target audience

The system will extract competency units from your TSC and generate a structured Course Proposal that you can review, edit, and export as a Word document.

**Tip:** Make sure your TSC document is clear and complete for the best results.

## Instructions
When users ask about creating course proposals, CP, or setting up new courses:

1. **Required Input**: TSC (Training & Competency Standards) document
2. **Key Fields**:
   - Course Title
   - Course Duration (hours)
   - Target Audience
   - Learning Outcomes (mapped to competency units)
   - Entry Requirements
   - Assessment Methods
3. **Process**:
   - Upload TSC document to extract competency units
   - System generates course structure based on TSC
   - User reviews and edits generated proposal
   - Export as Word document
4. **Tips**:
   - Ensure TSC document is in PDF or Word format
   - Learning outcomes should be measurable and specific
   - Duration should align with competency complexity

## Capabilities
- Guide users through the CP creation process

This skill runs using **Claude Code with subscription plan**. Do NOT use pay-as-you-go API keys. All AI operations should be executed through the Claude Code CLI environment with an active subscription.

## Response
I'll take you to **Courseware Audit** now.

Here's what you can do:
- **Upload** your supporting documents (CP, AP, FG, LG, LP, etc.)
- The system will check for completeness, formatting, and alignment between documents

This helps ensure your documents meet SSG submission requirements before you submit.

## Instructions
When users ask about checking, validating, or verifying documents:

1. **Required Input**: Supporting documents (CP, AP, FG, LG, LP)
2. **What Gets Checked**:
   - Document completeness
   - Format compliance
   - Cross-document alignment
   - Learning outcome mapping
3. **Process**:
   - Upload documents to check
   - System analyses and validates
   - Review findings and recommendations
4. **Tips**:
   - Upload all related documents together for cross-checking
   - Fix issues before SSG submission

## Capabilities
- Validate supporting documents for completeness
- Check format compliance
- Cross-reference between documents
- Direct users to use the "Courseware Audit" module in the sidebar

## Next Steps
Once your documents pass validation, you're ready for SSG submission! If you need to fix anything:
- **Regenerate courseware** — say *"generate courseware"*
- **Regenerate assessments** — say *"create assessment"*
